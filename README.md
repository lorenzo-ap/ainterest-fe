## Overview

This repository is a front-end application designed to generate images, likely leveraging an AI-based API. This project, created by [**lorenzo-ap**](https://github.com/lorenzo-ap), provides a user interface to input prompts and display generated images.

## Features

- **Prompt Input**: Users can enter text prompts to generate custom images.
- **Image Display**: Renders generated images in the UI.
- **API Integration**: Connects to a backend or third-party API for image generation.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with modern front-end technologies for cross-device compatibility.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or higher (recommended).
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js for package management.
- **.env setup**: See `.env.example` as an example.

## Configuration with `.env`

The `.env` file is used to store environment-specific variables, such as API keys or endpoints, securely. It is not committed to the repository for security reasons.

### Creating the `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with required variables, e.g.:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:9999/api
```
